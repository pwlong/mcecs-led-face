==============

Control software for led array implementation of robot eyes and mouth. This stuff runs on Arduino
and makes use of some of the libraries provided by adafruit insustries. You'll need:
Adafruit LED Backpack library and
Adafruit GFX library 

If you are versed in the ways of Git (and you are here so perhaps you are), you can go get the files
at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library and
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library

Or you can just got get their conveniently zipped up contents at:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library/archive/master.zip and
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/archive/master.zip

Once you have those, you have to meve the stuff to the tright place in your arduino installation.
Those instructions are beyond the scope of this README but adafruit has some good directions at:
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-led-backpack/downloads
That page also has all the above links.
